        <h2>Reason for Applying for a Job:</h2>
        <p class="summary-body"><strong>Video games have always been my passion</strong>, but I couldn’t even imagine that one day my job may have become connected with the thing, that gives me so much pleasure and positivity.<br>
          During last 5 years I’ve been involved into managing teams and international projects in the sphere of sales and finances. It was great experience, that not only gave me professional development, but also made me <strong>a highly organized and open minded team player, able to solve different kinds of problems and to adapt fast to new responsibilities</strong>.<br><br>          
          Nevertheless, the day came when I decided to change the direction of my career and personal development – I chose IT sphere, because it’s so dynamic and progressive and because modern technologies have always been interesting and attractive to me. I started to work on my technical background by completing courses and studying new technologies.<br>         
          I had a possibility not to be in a hurry and <strong>to find the career path, which would be truly mine</strong>.<br><br> 
          One day I read about the profession of a <strong>User Acquisition/Traffic Manager in GameDev industry</strong> and I felt excited - this kind of job seemed interesting to me and it was so about my mindset and character.<br>
          I understood that if I got a set of special knowledge in GameDev, I would really suit this position, because I am good at work with great amounts of various data, its analysis and systematization, as well as in making conclusions and predictions on its basis.<br>
          That's why I found highly recommended proper courses on &quot;devtodev&quot; and stepped to my new career path.
